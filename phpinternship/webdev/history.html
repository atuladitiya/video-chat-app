        <h2> History</h2>
        <p> Enter the Webcam While highfalutin business executives were hamming it up with their $100,000 ISDN videoconferencing systems, consumers were busy too. In 1994, a small company called Connectix shipped the QuickCam, now considered the first webcam. The first model could only capture a 320-by-240 image at 16 shades of grey - and then only on a Mac-but its $99 price blew the market wide open. Inventive users combined the QuickCam, the emerging Internet, and videoconferencing software like CU-SeeMe (seen here) to take part in the first Internet video chats in the mid-1990s.The Picturephone I This Bell System Picturephone premiered with great fanfare at the 1964 World's Fair in New York. Like earlier prototypes, the Picturephone required special wiring to work, so it wasn't compatible with the existing telephone network at large. AT&T did its best to drum up hype for its futuristic phone, even staging a call between Lady Bird Johnson in Washington DC and Bell Labs in NY. This model entered limited commercial service between Washington, New York, and Chicago that year, but failed to take off. At $16-$27 for a three-minute call (that's $112-$189 in 2010 dollars), it's easy to see why.The Picturephone II Public polls after the first Picturephone launch revealed that consumers weren't thrilled with AT&T's offering for a number of reasons. It was too expensive, the controls were too difficult to operate, the screen was too small, and people just didn't like being observed over the phone. Never content to admit defeat, AT&T tried again in 1970 with the Picturephone II, seen here, which entered commercial service in Pittsburgh. It didn't last long, however, and AT&T went back to the drawing board.The Picturephone II Public polls after the first Picturephone launch revealed that consumers weren't thrilled with AT&T's offering for a number of reasons.

It sent video at 3-7 frames per second over Japan's PHS and weighed over a pound. To the right of that is the Kyocera VP-210 (1999), one of the first (if not the first) commercial cellular phones to offer video calling. Then we enter the 3G network era with the Sony Ericsson Z1010 (2003) and the NEC e606 (far right, 2003); both offered color video calling. Despite the availability of video calling on some phones throughout the 2000s, users still didn't consider it an essential feature.The Video Chat Revolution Online video chat was booming by the mid 2000s, thanks to cheap color cameras, free software, ubiquitous PCs, and widespread broadband. By 2003, all the major instant messaging clients supported video calling. An array of webcams appeared from vendors like Logitech, Microsoft, and Apple. Skype began offering video in 2005. Video calling had crept in under the noses of a formerly skittish-to-be-seen populace in a surprising way. A younger generation viewed video chat as a new communications paradigm separate from the traditional concept of the "video telephone." The difference became clear: If you want to talk, use a phone. If you want to video chat, use a webcam.

Such devices remained attractive in business circles, where budgets were higher and executives considered face-to-face contact especially important. Companies began manufacturing IP (Internet Protocol) phones for use over IP networks like the Internet. Here we see a selection of IP phone models, including the Nortel 1535 (lower right, 2007) and the D-Link DVC-3000 (upper left, 2008). By this time, it was clear that consumers were apathetic about dedicated videophones, so none of these devices targeted them. Photos: Nortel/D-Link/Grandstream/ACN/Amstrad. Carrying this tradition forward we have designed this site keeing in mind the pandemic and the problem people were suffering because of being struck in negative and frustrating environments.
